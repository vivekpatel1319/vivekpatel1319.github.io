<h2><a name="Receiving_Encrypted_Email"></a>Receiving Encrypted Email</h2>

<p>You have received a secure, encrypted message from the sender.</p>

<p>Click the attachment in the message to launch a browser to 
 authenticate so that you can decrypt and read the message.</p>

<p> <b>Note:</b> If you see red X icons in the browser, your email client is blocking images. 
 These images are typically the logo or images of the sender's organization. 
 You can display the images or ignore them without affecting your ability 
 to read the message.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have not registered for Proofpoint 
 Encryption, you will be prompted to create an account and choose a password 
 on the <b>Registration</b> page. Click 
 <b>Continue</b> when you are done. In 
 the future, you will not be prompted to register.
</li>
<li>If you have already registered, or if 
 your account already exits, you will be prompted to sign in and provide 
 your password to decrypt the message. Click <b>Continue</b>.</li>
<li> If you sign in, and the Login screen returns with a field that you can edit for your user name, it means Proofpoint Encryption found a record for you, but the email address is different - perhaps an email alias. Enter a different address to sign in. For example, a record for <i>jsmith@example.com</i> exists, but you entered <i>joe@example.com</i> - your alias for <i>jsmith</i>.

</li></ul>

<p> <b>Forgot your password?</b></p>

<p>If Proofpoint Encryption is configured to allow you to reset your password, 
 click the <b>Forgot Password</b> link.
 You will be prompted for your security question. Create a new password for your account.</p>


<h2><a name="Replying_or_Forwarding"></a>Replying or Forwarding</h2>

<p>Your ability to reply to or forward an encrypted message depends upon 
 the sending organization's policies. If you do not see a <b>Reply</b>, <b>Reply All</b>, or <b> Forward</b> link, it is because the sender of the message cannot allow recipients to reply to or forward the message. 
</p><p>When you reply to a message, your reply will be sent securely. </p>

<h2><a name="Adding_Recipients"></a>Adding Recipients</h2>

<p>The ability to add or edit the recipient list when you reply to a message depends upon the sending organization's policies. The <b>To</b> and <b>CC</b> recipient fields will either be fixed so that you cannot change them, or you will be allowed to add or delete recipients from these fields. Separate multiple recipients with a comma.</p>
<p>When you forward a message, you can always edit the recipient list.</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> The sender's organization has the option to restrict secure messages to specific domains. If this is the case, you will see an error message if you try to forward a secure message to a recipient that is not allowed to receive it.</p>
 

<h2>Send me a copy</h2>
<p>Proofpoint Encryption does not automatically place a copy of a secure message in your <i>Sent</i> folder. Click <b>Send me a copy</b> when you forward or reply to a secure message so that a copy will be sent to your address for your records.</p>

<h2><a name="Adding_an_Attachment_to_Encrypted_Email"></a>Adding an Attachment 
 to Encrypted Email</h2>
<p>If you want to add 
 an attachment to a message, click the <b>Attach a file</b> link. Navigate to 
 the file you want to attach and then click the <b>Add</b> 
 link. The name of the attached file displays in the dialog box. Click 
 <b>Upload</b> when you are done adding attachments.</p>
<p>To delete an attachment from a message, click the <b>X</b> link to the right of the attachment.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> 
 The (combined) attachments cannot exceed 15 MB in size. </p>

<h2><a name="Resetting_Your_Expired_Password"></a>Resetting Your Expired Password</h2>
<p>Your email administrator can force your password to expire after a designated period of time according to your organization's security policies. You will see a "Days until password expiration" message when you read or compose a secure message. Click the link to reset your password. If your password expires before you have a chance to reset it, you will be prompted to reset your password the next time you try to compose or read a secure message.</p>
<p>You may also be required to reset your password the first time you log in to Proofpoint Encryption depending on how your account was initially set up by the administrator. Or, if you forgot your password and your administrator gives you a new temporary password, you will be required to reset it and select new security questions.</p>

<h2><a name="Reading_a_Secure_Message_on_a_Smart_Phone"></a>Reading a Secure Message on a Smart Phone</h2>
<p>Some Smart Phones cannot download files, and some Smart Phones modify HTML files. Since your secure message is sent to you as an HTML attachment, you may not be able to read it on your Smart Phone. If you have trouble reading your secure message, follow the instructions to forward the message to another server. You will then be able to download the message from the server to read it.</p>

<p><b>Other Issues</b></p>
<p>
<i>Error with Large HTML Secure Messages.</i>
</p><p>
If your HTML message contains more than 500 KB of content, you may encounter a "Large Message Warning" error message. This limitation applies to Firefox 3.X or Internet Explorer browsers when you reply to the message or forward it. This limitation does not apply to plain text.
</p><p>
<i>Intermittent Problem with Replying to or Forwarding Secure Messages</i>
</p><p>

If Proofpoint Encryption hangs when you try to compose a message and click the
Reply, Reply All, or Forward links, click Cancel and try again.

If the original text of the secure message does not display in the browser,
refresh the browser or close the browser and open it again.

The behavior is infrequent, intermittent, and typically works the second time around.

</p><p>
<i>If you use Outlook 2007 on Windows Vista.</i>
</p><p>Do not save the <i>SecureMessageAtt.htm</i> attachment to disk and then try to open it. Open it from the email message.
